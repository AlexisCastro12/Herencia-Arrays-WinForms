## :dart: Description ##

Inheritance Arrays WinForms is a software developed using C# in Windows Forms of the .NET Framework (4.7) in the Visual Studio 2019 IDE. This program demonstrates the inheritance between classes, an intrinsic feature within the world of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

The project allows to work with 1 or 2 dimensional Arrays executing basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) with the objective of exemplifying the application of class inheritance in C# knowing its advantages and limitations. The program considers each array and operation as a class that can inherit or be inherited from another one and at the end all these relations are created and executed from the main form.

This software can be used by students in the last semesters of high school, also by those who are starting an engineering career or who require an additional tool (calculator) to work with arrays of 1 or 2 dimensions. In addition, it can help the community of programmers who begin their way into the world of OOP since some concepts such as constructors, objects, instances and inheritance are applied in the source code and graphically represented in the class diagram built by Visual Studio.

## :sparkles: Features

Currently, the characteristics that this project has are:

:heavy_check_mark: A graphical user interface (GUI) with text entries for entering the dimension of the two matrices to be operated on. Also, it includes buttons to perform read, write and operations on the matrices. Also, there is a Listbox where the results of the different operations performed are displayed.

:heavy_check_mark: Error prevention and error handling is available by locking some controls and displaying error messages with possible solutions at the bottom left of the IGU.

:heavy_check_mark: User can fill arrays with arbitrary data.

:heavy_check_mark: The results are displayed as a small history that is cleared each time the program is restarted.

The initial objective of this project is to apply the concepts of OOP (objects, classes, constructors, instances and inheritance) in the C# programming language. So far the objective has been achieved, however there are many areas of opportunity to scale this application and give it more functionality. Some proposals for future improvements are:

:pushpin: Define the dimension of arrays individually.

:pushpin: Allow to operate with 3, 4 or up to 5 arrays depending on the user's needs.

:pushpin: Add more operations that are common for students or users to whom this application is directed.

:pushpin: Add a section to work with imaginary numbers.

### :mag_right: Remarks

:bell: The size of the arrays will always be limited to the memory capacity of the computer where the program is executed.

:bell: There is a window that pops up with the developer's credentials in the "Archivo" tab under the "Firma" option. To close it just click on any image or text inside it.

You can remove the credentials by deleting the application "Castro.exe" from the "/bin/debug" directory. You must also delete the control and the event that triggers its opening, these are located in the source code of the main form.

## :white_check_mark: Requirements

Before starting :checkered_flag:, you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

Remember that the application can only be run on Windows OS :computer:.

## :checkered_flag: Starting

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/AlexisCastro12/Herencia-Arrays-WinForms.git

```

Find the folder in the path where the clone was made and go to './bin/Debug/' and run as administrator the application WFHerenciaMat1.exe.

Initially, most of the functions are locked. You need to do the following to get results on the calculator:

1. Create both arrays entering the desired dimensions
2. Fill with numbers all the spaces in each array.
3. Read the array data using the "Leer Matrices" button.

The buttons that allow mathematical operations with the matrices will be unlocked immediately and the results will be printed in the blank space on the right.
